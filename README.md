## Description

This project aims to showcase my proficiency in web development. Below it is an overview of the project and the various features and techniques I have implemented.

## Listing of Ideas

Here are some exciting ideas I thought of when creating this website.

+ A big bullseye icon that whenever the user hovers the cursor on top an arrow is thrown in the middle
+ A short menu on the right side of the page, when the user clicks on one of the nav options, the text changes
+ A list at the bottom right side with icons for social media links
+ Desktop view divided into two grids, the right one will be scrollable, but a few things stay on place

## Project Overview

The goal of this website is to create a visually attractive and interactive website using my web development skills.
